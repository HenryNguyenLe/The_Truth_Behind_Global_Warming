# Global Warming | 164-year History of Hurricanes
## 1. Background
Global Warming with its effects on human lives and other creatures on planet Earth has always been a controversial topic for the past many decades and no doubt would remain one of the hottest topics for many more years to come. One of the infamous effects of Global Warming is devastating storms. NASA claimed that due to Global Warming, "Hurricanes will become stronger and more intense". Whether this is true or not, let's explore and ask data to speak the truth.

In this project, tropical storms/ hurricanes data from 1851 â€“ 2015 were processed, cleaned, analyzed and visualized by utilizing Python.
